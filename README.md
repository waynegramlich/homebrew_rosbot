The following PCB's are available:

* [Busino](https://github.com/waynegramlich/busino).
  The Busino is an Arduino compatible PCB that can be connected
  to a bus.  It has attach points for up to 4 mini-shields.

  * [BeagleBone Black Mini-Shield](https://github.com/waynegramlich/mini_beaglebone_black).
    The BeagleBone Black mini-shield provides a Busino connection to
    a beaglebone black processor.

  * [Bridge Encoders Sonar Mini-Shield](https://github.com/waynegramlich/mini_bridge_encoders_sonar).
    The Bridge Encoders Sonar mini-shield provides a dual H-bride
    to drive two small motors, a couple of quadrature shaft encoder
    inputs for doing dead reckoning, and a couple of sonar inputs
    for inexpensive HC-SR04 sonars.

  * [Power Mini-Shield](https://github.com/waynegramlich/mini_power).
    The Power mini-shield provides the ability to attach two separate
    batteries to Busino.  There is polarity protection and fuse
    protection.  Finally, there is an On/Off switch.

  * [Raspberry Pi Mini-Shield](https://github.com/waynegramlich/mini_raspberry_pi)
    The Raspberry Pi mini-shield provides a Busino connection to
    a Raspberry Pi processor.

* [Dual Slot Encoders](https://github.com/waynegramlich/dual_slot_encoders).
    The dual slot encoders PCB provides a quadrature encoder using
    a couple of optical interrupter slot sensors.  A encode disk
    is needed to complete the system.

* Bus based PCBS:

  * [BeagleBone Black Bus Module](https://github.com/waynegramlich/bus_beaglebone).
    This module simple provides an ATmega324P as a bridging processor
    between a Beaglebone Black and the bus.

  * [Bridge Encoders Sonar Bus Module](https://github.com/waynegramlich/bus_bridge_encoders_sonar).
    This module is optimized to privide just provide a 1 Ampere dual
    H-bridge, 2 quadrature encoders, and 2 sonars that connect to the
    bus.

  * [Power Bus Module](https://github.com/waynegramlich/bus_power).
    This module strictly provides power to the bus with polarity
    protection, over current protection and an on-off switch.

  * [Raspberry Pi Bus Module](https://github.com/waynegramlich/bus_raspberry_pi).
    This module simple provides an ATmega324P as a bridging processor
    between a Raspberry Pi Modle B+ and the bus.

  * [Sonar10 Bus Module](https://github.com/waynegramlich/sonar10).
    This module provides a bus interface to drive up to 10 HC-SR04
    sonar modules.
